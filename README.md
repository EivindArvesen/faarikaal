# Faarikaal Theme

A monochromatic, minimalistic, flat and dark theme for Sublime Text 3 that aims to put focus on your code and make other elements less intrusive.

Based upon the brilliant [Soda Theme](http://buymeasoda.github.io/soda-theme/),
with inspiration from Gravity, El Capitan, Haft Lang, Devastate and Spacegray...

Using icons from the great [Font Awesome][http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/]

## Installation

Faarikaal theme is designed to work with the latest beta builds of [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3).

### Using Sublime Package Control

If you are using Will Bond's excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can easily install Soda Theme via the `Package Control: Install Package` menu item. The Soda Theme package is listed as `Theme - Faarikaal` in the packages list.

### Using Git

Alternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text application settings area.

You can locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/ "Theme - Faarikaal"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `faarikaal`
* Find your `Packages` directory using the menu item  `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`
* Copy the folder into your Sublime Text `Packages` directory

## Activating the theme

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Faarikaal.sublime-theme"`
